 1. H1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: For the H1 - that's the primary heading at the top of the article. Use the word "overview" for consistency after the feature or service.
-->

<!---
--->

# <area> overview
TODO: Add your heading

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: The introductory paragraph helps customers quickly determine whether an article is relevant.
Describe in customer-friendly terms what the  or feature is and does, and why the customer should care. Keep it short for the intro.
You can go into more detail later in the article. Many services add artwork or videos below the introduction.
-->

[Introductory paragraph]
TODO: Add your introductory paragraph

<!---Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them. Better to put that info directly into the article text.--->

<!-- 3. Article body ------------------------------------------------------------
Required: After the intro, you can develop your overview by discussing the features that answer the "Why should I care" question with a bit more depth.
Be sure to call out any basic requirements and dependencies, as well as limitations or overhead.
Don't catalog every feature, and some may only need to be mentioned as available, without any discussion.
-->

<!-- Top tasks ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suggested:
An effective way to structure you overview article is to create an H2 for the top customer tasks you identified during the planning process and describe how the product/service helps customers with that task.

Create a new H2 for each task you list. Task 
headings should start with an imperative verb, not a gerund (-ing form), e.g. "Configure a command" not "Configuring a command".

Use H3s for subareas within each task to break up.

## Task heading

<!-- 5. Next steps ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: In Overview articles, provide at least one next step.
Next steps in overview articles will often link to a tutorial or a conceptual article.
What you link to will depend on what is really a next step for the customer.
Do not use a "More info section" or a "Resources section" or a "See also section".
